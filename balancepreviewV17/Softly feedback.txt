[SGI]Softly: 
Frankly I think the mod is way ott
20:21


[SGI]Softly: 
:(



IceDreamer: 
That's fine, everyone has their opinions



IceDreamer: 
It doesn't all have to go in



IceDreamer: 
Which bits in particular are you thinking?



[SGI]Softly: 
Thats what gets said every time
20:22


IceDreamer: 
Even so
20:23


IceDreamer: 
Which bits would you prefer be removed, or toned down. Give advice



[SGI]Softly: 
My main issue is that theres a huge amount going on at once
20:24


[SGI]Softly: 
Things are changing for every part of the game, its too broad



IceDreamer: 
Which makes it hard to know what's having the proper effect. yes, I know. I'm afraid it's unavoidable since, as a mod, I can't chop and change things and expect testers to keep up



[SGI]Softly: 
If it was me, I would keep SCU changes and acu tml changes
20:25


[SGI]Softly: 
probably ditch almost all the rest



IceDreamer: 
Remember that some parts of this mod ARE going to be going live. The bugfixes, and the new UI stuff



[SGI]Softly: 
UI tweaks are fine
20:26


[SGI]Softly: 
like factory assist and damage warnings



IceDreamer: 
So let me pull the balance changes out for you one at a time, and you just say keep or ditch



IceDreamer: 
Factory Rolloff



[SGI]Softly: 
And target bone adjustments are necessary
20:27


[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
interesting, that;s one of the most highly requested features. Also, the target bone/hitboxes are going in. The complaints generated by the way those are at present are too high to ignore.



IceDreamer: 
errrm



IceDreamer: 
Nuke damage changes



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch
20:28


IceDreamer: 
Mongoose Muzzlevelocity



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
Air Changes



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
UEF Nano upgrade buff



[SGI]Softly: 
idc tbh, seems kinda gimmick



IceDreamer: 
The upgrade is utterly useless right now. People don't like that
20:29


[SGI]Softly: 
the proposed change won't fix that imo



IceDreamer: 
I don't think this change is gonna put that right entirely, but it's a step in the right direction



IceDreamer: 
agreed



IceDreamer: 
better to move slowly than not to move at all, or to go OTT



[SGI]Softly: 
I prefer no movement to ott
20:30


[SGI]Softly: 
It seems to me like thats what left us with the current scu situation



IceDreamer: 
Then you're going to get left behind, because the vast majority of the community take the other side of that stance



[SGI]Softly: 
citation needed



IceDreamer: 
What gave us the SCU situation was moving too fast and going OTT



IceDreamer: 
I warned them time and again the changes were too much, but pip didn't listen



[SGI]Softly: 
join the queue
20:31


IceDreamer: 
I get more than 100 people per week PMing me asking for changes mate



IceDreamer: 
and that's just me. Sheeo gets far more



IceDreamer: 
It's never-ending. The population aren't happy with the status quo
20:32


IceDreamer: 
anyway, let's continue



IceDreamer: 
Mavor, Absolver



[SGI]Softly: 
absolver fix yes, otherwise dtch



IceDreamer: 
Novax, Hoplite



[SGI]Softly: 
hoplite ditch, novax keep



IceDreamer: 
Hmm so with absolver, hover height yes, what about the range increase?
20:33


[SGI]Softly: 
only keep the fix for personal shields



[SGI]Softly: 
no range increase



IceDreamer: 
kk



IceDreamer: 
Broadsword/Wailer



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
Are there any of the token weapon section you would keep?
20:34


[SGI]Softly: 
Cybran trans aoe to 42, keep that :D



IceDreamer: 
For example some popular requests such as Corsair MuzzleVelocity nerf and Othuum DPS switch are in there



[SGI]Softly: 
Othuum dps switch maybe



IceDreamer: 
Hover changes?
20:35


[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
Interesting



IceDreamer: 
Cybran ACU
20:36


[SGI]Softly: 
especially wagner speed boost



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
again interesting, highly highly requested



IceDreamer: 
Flack?



[SGI]Softly: 
useless change imo



IceDreamer: 
In what way?



[SGI]Softly: 
The places this is a problem are teamgames with dedicated air
20:37


IceDreamer: 
Flack can now hit Strats and ASF nicely to stop early T3 Air



IceDreamer: 
hmmm



IceDreamer: 
ok, SCUs



[SGI]Softly: 
stat flack will offer no protection to raiding



[SGI]Softly: 
unless you cover your base with them



[SGI]Softly: 
And give up air by default



[SGI]Softly: 
The whole point of strat rush is that opp air player has no high tier buildpower anywhere except by air fac



[SGI]Softly: 
let alone t2
20:38


IceDreamer: 
This isn't about Air play vs Air play, I think



IceDreamer: 
The complaint came largely from ladder players annoyed by the strength of strat rush killing all the BP and E



[SGI]Softly: 
I never have this problem on ladder tbh



IceDreamer: 
kk
20:39


IceDreamer: 
SCUs?



IceDreamer: 
You got any comments on the changes included in there?



[SGI]Softly: 
hitbox fixes yes



[SGI]Softly: 
I dislike oc change



IceDreamer: 
As do I



[SGI]Softly: 
mostly ok with scu changes though
20:40


IceDreamer: 
but as always, not my call.



IceDreamer: 
Righto



IceDreamer: 
T2 Arty



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
Late game eco



[SGI]Softly: 
ditch



IceDreamer: 
and finally, vet



[SGI]Softly: 
Thats a huge balance change on its own



[SGI]Softly: 
It should have its own mod
20:41


[SGI]Softly: 
I would ditch it within this mod, but not against it in principle



IceDreamer: 
Cool, I'll save this conversation somewhere. Am I right in thinking that some of the things you've said ditch to are not necessarily because you're against them, but because it's too much at once?



[SGI]Softly: 
Just think its not very workable



[SGI]Softly: 
About half are



IceDreamer: 
Righto



[SGI]Softly: 
Like changing "token" aa weapons
20:42
